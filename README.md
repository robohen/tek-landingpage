Used React to create the components for a personal website that will be used to post future blog posts/projects. 
React-Redux to keep the state of the night mode in order throughout the application that takes into account local storage. 
There is a Projects tab that displays the other projects that I am working on/ have finished.
There is a Pokemon tab that has a button when pressed shows the name and an image of the Pokemon which is randomly shown to the user.
I could not get the state to stick to the text that was within the center of the project the text would stay black when changing sections through the NavBar.
